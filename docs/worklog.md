# Work log

Append-only. Newest at the bottom. One entry per task, written *before* the
commit so it ships inside the commit it describes — that is why `push:` says
"this commit" rather than a sha. Never rewrite an entry; add a `FIX` entry
below it instead. Past ~300 lines, move everything older than the current year
to `docs/worklog-archive.md` in one commit.

Kinds: `OK` (worked) · `ERR` (broke) · `FIX` (resolved an ERR) · `SESSION` (close-out).

    ### <YYYY-MM-DD> · <OK|ERR|FIX|SESSION> · <one-line title>
    - what: <change made, or symptom observed> — file:line
    - checks: checks.sh <ok|FAIL> · manual: <what you clicked, or none>
    - push: <this commit | not pushed | rebased onto N browser commits>
    - note: <optional — surprise, follow-up, OPT-nn raised>

### 2026-08-07 · OK · Add docs/checks.sh and prove it catches both failure modes
- what: `docs/checks.sh` — greps every `on*=` handler name against declarations
  in `site.js` (R2), and every page for the six sentinel ids (R3)
- checks: checks.sh ok · manual: fault-injected both rules — renamed
  `toggleEdit` in shared/site.js and stripped `id="de-toast"` from
  projects/hot-potato.html; script reported both and exited 1; reverted via
  `git checkout` and re-verified exit 0
- push: this commit
- note: written for `bash`, not fish — the handler check needs process
  substitution. Invoke as `bash docs/checks.sh`.

### 2026-08-07 · ERR · Working tree held a parallel session's uncommitted commit
- what: `bd92d14` appeared on main mid-task, authored by a second Claude session
  in this same clone; it swept my untracked `docs/checks.sh` into its commit.
  `git status` came back clean when two untracked files were expected.
- checks: checks.sh ok · manual: inspected reflog, commit metadata, tree
- push: not pushed
- note: initially misread it as having deleted two Gotchas from CLAUDE.md. It
  had not — it promoted them into R1 and R3 of a new Working agreement section.
  Its R3 is more precise than my draft: `#de-toast` is null-guarded, so losing
  it degrades quietly rather than fatally.

### 2026-08-07 · FIX · Built on the parallel commit instead of rewriting it
- what: kept `bd92d14`, extended its R1–R3 to ten rules plus loops L1–L4
- checks: checks.sh ok · manual: none
- push: not pushed
- note: no history rewritten; the other session's commit message stands.

### 2026-08-07 · OK · Rebased onto 17 upstream commits and repaired the doc
- what: L2 step 2 caught `origin/main` 17 commits ahead. `shared/site.js` had
  grown 2465 → 3056 lines, `portfolio.css` by 609, and `shared/theme.css` was
  new. Rebased with `--autostash` (clean, no conflicts — `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/`
  don't exist upstream), then re-verified every factual claim in the rules and
  the backlog against the new tree.
- checks: checks.sh ok — passes against `origin/main` too, so the checks
  survived the upstream rewrite · manual: none (no site code changed)
- push: rebased onto 17 browser commits; not pushed
- note: 18 of the 19 `shared/site.js:NNN` citations in CLAUDE.md were pointing
  at unrelated code; only `asset()` at :17 survived. All corrected. Filed
  OPT-12 to stop this recurring. Backed the work up to the scratchpad before
  rebasing.

### 2026-08-07 · SESSION · Working agreement in place
- shipped: `CLAUDE.md` Working agreement (R1–R10, L1–L4), `docs/checks.sh`,
  `docs/worklog.md`, `docs/backlog.md` (OPT-01…OPT-12), `.claude/settings.json`
- open: nothing committed yet beyond `bd92d14` — awaiting review of the second
  commit; `.claude/settings.json` takes effect only on the next session start
- next: OPT-12 (make doc line-number rot a check failure) is the natural
  follow-on, since it protects everything written this session
